On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	first.txt
	lesson_2_reflections.txt
	second.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
